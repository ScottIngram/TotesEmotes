# Totes Emotes

A World of Warcraft addon

---

Totes Emotes aims to put your favorite emotes just two or three keystrokes away. Or mouse clicks if you prefer.

Blah blah organize, sort, trigger, etc.

### FAQ:

**Q:** How do I access Totes Emotes?  
**A:** Any of the following will display the Emote Menu Button:

### Tips & Tricks:

- **Quick Keys** - While the emote menu is visible, you can navigate the menus and trigger emotes via key presses.
