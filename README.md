# Totes Emotes

A World of Warcraft addon

---

Totes Emotes aims to put your favorite emotes just two or three keystrokes (or mouse clicks) away.

All existing emotes are organized into categories and presented in a new (movable and resizable) menu window.  Navigate the menu with clicks of the mouse, arrow keys, or by pressing a row's number.

Search speedily for any emote!  While the menu is open, anything you type will act as a filter and shrink the menu of emotes to just those that match.

### Tips & Tricks:

- **Keybind** - the menu can be toggled via keybind (I use shift-enter).  The keybind can be set in Totes Emotes config screen and also standard "AddoOns" sections of the WoW keybinds config menu.

- **Quick Keys** - While the emote menu is visible you can navigate and trigger emotes via key presses:  Each line in the menu is numbered and the number keys trigger the corresponding emote or open that category.  The up & down arrows select a line.  Enter triggers the selection.  The Delete key exits a category and goes to the parent menu, or if already on the parent, it will close thes window entirely.
