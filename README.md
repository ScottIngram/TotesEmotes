# Totes Emotes

A World of Warcraft addon

---

Totes Emotes aims to put your favorite emotes just two or three keystrokes away. Or mouse clicks if you prefer.

All emotes are organized into a categorized menu.  Navigate the menu with clicks of the mouse or by pressing a category or emote's corresponding number.

### FAQ:

**Q:** How do I access Totes Emotes?  
**A:** Any of the following will display the Emote Menu Button:
- Type `/totes toggle`
- Click "TotesEmotes" in the Addon Compartment (the new menu Blizzard added in Dragonflight to the upper right corner of the minimap).

**Q:** How do I close the menu?  
**A:** Pressing Escape or click the "Emotes" button


### Tips & Tricks:

- **Keybind** - the menu can be toggled via keybind (the default is control-/ but you may prefer shift-/).  The keybind can be changed in the "AddoOns" sections of the WoW keybinds config menu.

- **Quick Keys** - While the emote menu is visible, you can navigate the menus and trigger emotes via key presses.

- **TODO - REALLY Quick Keys** - Even while the emote menu is hidden, you can just point at the Emote Menu Button and trigger emotes via the same key presses.
